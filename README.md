# Project 1 

Project 1 includes a calculator application that mirrors the default iPhone calculator with its standard digit and operand buttons and corresponding functionality.

## Functionality 

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* User sees a friendly interface resembling the default iPhone calculator.
* User can perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) using the calculator's digit and operand buttons.
* User can enter a number (which is displayed on the top textview) and can click an operator followed by another number, which will result in the evaluation of the expression (for which the answer is returned in the top textview).
* Users have the option to use the '+/-' button to toggle the sign of numbers, making them either positive or negative.
* Users can utilize the '%' button to transform a number into its decimal representation.

## Extensions

* The original functionality of the calculator was not modified.
* Potential extensions include, horizontal layout with scientific calculator functionality.
